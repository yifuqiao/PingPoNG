Demonstrates simple hill climbing:

Right now the AI only increaseses its speed since its always the best option, but if I 
add acceleration/slipperiness then it should speed up and slow down.

Also, the collision is a bit off since I'm using a sphere vs sphere (even for the paddles) 
which doesn't look that good.
